# Medical-Image-Analysis-Lab-1

This Laboratory Practice consists of adding different types of noise, with different intensities, to several medical images. The resulting images are then to be filtered through Non-Local Means (NLM) method and Anistropic diffusion.

The noise_filtering_f function is imported into both Jupyter Noteeboks: The first one adds noise and implements the NLM filtering to the obtained noisy images, whereas the second one filters noisy images by anisotropic diffusion.
